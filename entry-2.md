# Indepent Study Week Two 


## How I Settled on a Topic Choice

This is my second week diving into PHP. A lot of what I did this week was figuring out what learning style was right for me. The first week I was not sure what I wanted to choose as a topic. What I was thinking about when picking a topic was what I already knew, and what I needed to know to make my app complete. I already knew front end things like HTML and CSS. I also knew back end Ruby and MCV sinatra. I thought to make everything complete I could learn how to make it possible for a user to log in. I started searching databases but I did not like it very much. Then I thought I could possibly make it possible for a user to submit a form to an email. A form going to an email that someone else could later read seemed more useful then going to an empty results page. That is when I stumbled upon PHP

## What is PHP? 

PHP is an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP works with HTML. What it does is it takes the content from the HTML and does something with it. PHP can be used to make dynamic websites. For example: If were to make a form with HTML that asks for a name, with PHP I can store the name in a variable like this `$name` Then I can print it out. If I change the name in the form then the value of the variable will also change. This is just like many other programing languages such as ruby. 

Another cool thing that PHP can do is make connections to databases. This means that with PHP we can actually make a login. After a form is made with HTML asking for user login information, it is given to a PHP script that tests to see not only if the information is the correct user information, but also if the email and password syntax is correct.The information will then be sent to a database Where the information is stored. When you login the PHP script checks with the database to make sure the information submitted matches up.


## My Learning Strategies

This week, more than anything, I tried to focus on learning what PHP is and what I could do with it. I know that I learn best by using all of my senses so just reading articles does not work for me at all. What I determined to be the most effective way to teach myself was looking at videos that explained the topic with a lot of visuals that was created as they spoke. This helped me grasp the concepts much more than my original attempt of reading about pHP. I also started to tinker just to get the hang of the syntax such as the variables like `name` or how you make a PHP tag: `<?php code goes here?>` I also Looked for a lot of similarities from coding languages I already knew such as `print` which prints out a variable, or different loops that I also learned in ruby. 



## Steps for next week

week 3- I would like to dive deeper into the syntax and looking at PHP code and really understanding what each line of code means and is used for. I would like to also use what I learned to tinker without looking everything up 


## Takeaways

1. Make sure you know how you learn best. Some people may learn better from reading others may need to just tinker and figure things out their self. 
2. Take what you already know and use it to what you are learning. A lot of these languages have similar functions and syntaxes. Use that!
3. Make sure you really understand how everything works rather then just copying what you see on the internet. That's not learning.
