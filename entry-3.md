# Independent Study Week Three 

## What I did this week: 

This has been my third week of independent study.  What I mainly focused on was learning the language PHP before I even started to create anything. At first I looked at codecademy because it is a site that I am familiar with. Here I found one small lesson on PHP. This only took a day to complete so I needed more. I started searching for things that were like codecademy. I used keywords like “Tutorial.” I came across a site that was great because it allowed you to see the code and manipulate it. There is a link to this site: http://www.learn-php.org/en/ There are different sections that teach you different aspects of PHP. For example there is one for strings and one for arrays and one for for loops. I spent a lot of time looking through this and trying out different things. I also jotted down some notes to help me because when I write things out I often process it better. 


## What I learned 

Looking at how the syntax works and what PHP does I came to the realization that it is very similar to Ruby. Most of the things you could do with Ruby you could also do with PHP. There is a few syntax differences with php though. For example rather than saying `return` as you would with ruby, you would say `echo` with PHP. Also a lot of the methods in rudy would be at the end of what you are inflicting the method on. In PHP it is in the beginning. For example if I wanted to count the items in an array with ruby I would do `arry.count` whereas PHP it is `count($arry)`. Small differences like this I had to watch out for but it for sure was useful knowing ruby before learning PHP. 


## Takeaways 

Make sure you know how you want to learn and your keyword search matches up with what/ how you decided to learn. 
Before you jump into building anything make sure you are comfortable with the language you are learning.  
When you write things down it helps you process it and learn it better. Jot notes while you learn. 

## Next steps 
 
Part of next week I would like to continue learning the syntax and for the other part I would like to start looking at very small labs and projects I can make myself with PHP to get comfortable with actually coding it.
